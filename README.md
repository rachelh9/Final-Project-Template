I am investigating how the change in sea ice extent can affect Alaskan salmon populations, specifically Coho salmon and Fall Chum salmon, in the Lower Yukon Area between 1990 and 2021. My hypothesis is that decreasing sea ice extent in the northern hemisphere and a thinner ice thickness in Shageluk Lake correlate to a fall in Alaskan salmon populations. To support my hypothesis, I plotted 3 figures: annual mean sea ice extent vs salmon population, climatology (daily mean sea ice extent) vs salmon population and shageluk lake ice thickness vs salmon population. The results showed that my hypothesis was proven wrong, and decreasing sea ice extent/ thickness actually increases salmon populations instead.
